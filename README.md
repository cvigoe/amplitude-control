# Amplitude Control Circuit Numerical Solution
This repo contains a MATLAB function to approximate the vector of unknowns X for the system of equations describing the non-linear amplitude control circuit used in the Alternative Phase Shift Oscillator circuit. The fucntion uses the multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson method to approximate the vector of unkowns. A simulation of the cirucit using the resistor values obtained from the MATLAB file is availble as an LTSpice simulation in the LT_SPICE_files directory.
